               "He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. 
                Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;
                but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.
                They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary,
                they will walk and not be faint."
                                                 - Isaiah 40:29-31
